    "p-tech":"💻 I love all sort of languages, tech languages too! That's why I started learning how to code. After following a Python course and attending a few tech conferences I decided to become a developer. Yay! So I studied a front end bootcamp and I fell in love (even more) with tech. You can take a look at some of the projects I did during this course in the section 'Projects'. When the bootcamp finished I continued learning on my own. Now I am following online courses to be better every day!",
    "p-hobbies":"🍂 When I am not coding you can find me reading about Psychology, History or Phylosophy, translating for fun, watching good horror films, wandering around the city or the nature, doing handcrafts or cooking.",
